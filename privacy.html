            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Eat My Bubbles is a personal swim tracking app designed for simplicity and clarity. 
                This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and 
                how it is stored.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                The app stores swim session data that you manually enter, such as distance, time, 
                and workout details. This data is stored locally on your device and, if enabled, 
                synced to your personal Firebase account.
            </p>
            <p>
                No personal information such as your name, email, or location is collected by the app.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
            <p>
                Your swim data is used solely to display your workout history and statistics within 
                the app. It is not shared with any third parties.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
                All data is stored locally on your device. If you choose to sync with Firebase, your 
                data is stored securely in your own Firebase account under your control.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The app may integrate with third‑party services such as Samsung Health. Any data 
                accessed from these services is used only within the app and is not transmitted 
                elsewhere.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>
                You may delete your swim data at any time from within the app. Uninstalling the app 
                will remove all locally stored data.
            </p>
